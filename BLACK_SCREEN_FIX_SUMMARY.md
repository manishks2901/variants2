# Black Screen Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The black screen issue in video transformations was caused by **extreme perspective transformation parameters** in several FFmpeg filter functions.

## Root Cause
Multiple perspective transformation functions were using coordinate values that could map the entire video frame outside the visible area, resulting in completely black output videos.

## Functions Fixed

### 1. `micro_perspective_warp_enhanced()`
**Problem**: Using invalid perspective coordinates like `"0:0:W:{shift}:W:H:0:H"`
**Fix**: 
- Changed to safe coordinates: `"0:0:W+{shift}:0:0:H:W+{shift}:H"`
- Reduced offset range from ±2-4px to ±1-2px
- Fixed shear coordinate format

### 2. `micro_perspective_warp()`
**Problem**: Similar invalid coordinate format
**Fix**:
- Changed `"0:0:W:{offset}:W:H:0:H"` to `"0:0:W+{offset}:0:0:H:W+{offset}:H"`
- Reduced shear amount from 1-3 to 1-2
- Simplified skew transformations to only use stable directions

### 3. `perspective_distortion()`
**Problem**: Using x0=, y0= parameter format with extreme values (±3-5px)
**Fix**:
- Reduced range from ±3px to ±2px
- Fixed coordinate format to use proper 8-point specification
- Changed from `perspective=x0={x0}:y0={y0}:...` to `perspective={x0}:{y0}:W+{x1}:...`

### 4. `random_geometric_warp()`
**Problem**: Extreme perspective offsets (±5px) and invalid coordinate format
**Fix**:
- Reduced perspective offsets from ±5px to ±2px
- Reduced shear offsets from ±2px to ±1px
- Fixed coordinate format for perspective transformations

### 5. `random_cut_jitter_effects()`
**Problem**: Extreme brightness values (-0.3, 0.3, -0.4, 0.4)
**Fix**:
- Reduced brightness range from ±0.3-0.4 to ±0.15-0.2
- Added fallback brightness reduction from ±0.2 to ±0.15

## Technical Details

### FFmpeg Perspective Filter Format
The perspective filter expects 8 coordinates in the format:
```
perspective=x0:y0:x1:y1:x2:y2:x3:y3
```
Where the coordinates represent the four corners of the output quadrilateral:
- (x0,y0) = top-left
- (x1,y1) = top-right  
- (x2,y2) = bottom-left
- (x3,y3) = bottom-right

### Safe Coordinate Ranges
- **Before**: Offsets up to ±5px which could push content completely off-screen
- **After**: Offsets limited to ±1-2px for subtle but effective transformations

### Brightness Safety
- **Before**: Brightness values as extreme as -0.4 (very dark) to +0.4 (very bright)
- **After**: Limited to ±0.15-0.2 for subtle variations that don't cause visibility issues

## Validation
All fixes have been tested and confirmed to:
1. Generate valid FFmpeg commands
2. Use safe parameter ranges that maintain video visibility
3. Preserve the transformation effectiveness for ORB/SIFT feature disruption
4. Prevent black screen outputs

## Impact
These fixes resolve the black screen issue while maintaining the core functionality of the transformation pipeline for content variation and feature detection evasion.
